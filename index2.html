  <div class="Description">
  <p> I am a visual artist who uses art as a mean of self-expression. I have a great passion for photography, drawing and digital art. I am often inspired by the art of cinematography, books and the events happening around me. 

With the constant improvement of technology, the humankind has become more influenced by the use of digital media. Despite being opened up to ways of connecting people, we end up losing ourselves to the virtual world. In short, the more we expose ourselves online, the more vulnerable and lonely we are. We’ve never before been more in need of seeking ways to express ourselves than now, that’s where art comes in. I’ve always been inspired by how human are able to convey motions through art beautifully, from happiness to sadness, and how we could make people feel the same way that we do. Therefore, I find art a way to emotionally connect to people and to deal with issues that evoke feelings.  <br> <br>
